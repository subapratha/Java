1. A.
I want to be a software engineer because I have interest in learning new things.
 When I make new things work  with the new things learnt it boosts up my confidence.
 Software is the field in which you can see instant results.
 When  my companies customers become benefitted with the code I write .
When I contribute in a field I have interest in and be a part of company's services it provides, I feel priviledged and proud
 that have spent  my time meaningful.This field has lots to learn in terms of handling people, deadline, time, resources, be committed and focussed in the tasks at hand.
 
 B. I want to grow up in my career ladder which I had to quit due to personal reasons . I want to upgrade my skills and learn new technologies and should be able to be a solution architect soon.
 
 C. PSG Software Technologies is part of PSG Institutions , the reputed organisation which I have seen and grown up and seen how they contribute to the society in terms of technology, quality and services.
 Being a part of this company is one of ways in which I can learn all the new things I cant learn elsewhere that easy and I can grow up with a fresh team and new ideas.
 
 D. I am a person of hard work. Given a task/goal , I commit myself 100% and make sure it is done as per the needs. I do have persistence and but I dont spend time on things which has no use even if I to work on. I am brave, confident, independant and learn my mistakes so I am sure I can be a good contributor.
